# Reflective Report:

### What does a RESTful API do?
A RESTful API is a way to allow software applications to communicate over the internet using standard
HTTP methods such as GET,POST,PUT and DELETE. Following a set of principles including statelessness which
means each request is independent and does not rely on other previous interactions. Data used in this project
is represented by URLs and responses are in the JSON format. 

### Why I developed on?
I wanted to make this Project as a way to further my understanding of databases, and the HTTP protocols. I also
wanted to have some experience dealing with APIs to have a deeper understanding of backend development, as I already have
front-end experience from my [Personal Portfolio Website](https://github.com/DanButterfield/Personal-Portfolio-Website)

### What I gained from it?
From this project as mentioned I gained experience from the backend of software development. I have also gained 
familiarity with FLASK and SQLAlchemy which I previously had very little of. I've also gained code now that I can adapt 
for future scenarios. I expanded my knowledge of RESTful APIs and have a deeper knowledge of them and this project
has allowed me to expand my toolkit after using more packages I wouldn't normally use
